# The-uncommon-evaluation-parameters-of-fusion-images-
There are Qab/f, IQM(Image quality metric), CEN(condition entropy),SNR(Signal-to-noise ratio),Entropy(EN),OCE(Overall cross entropy) in the evalution parameters.
Qab/f metric: It condiers the amount of edgee information transferred from the input images to the fused image. It should be close to 1 as much as possible.
Image quality metric (IQM)-based metric: The larger theIQM value, the better the fused result.
Condition entropy (CEN) of fused results: The larger the absolute CEN value, the better the fused result.
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): The fused image is looked upon as the ideal image (signal) plus the noise image (difference between the ideal image and the fused image). The larger the SNR value, the better the fused result.
Entropy (EN): It reflects the amount of information in the fused image. The larger the EN is, the more information the image carries.
Overall cross entropy (OCE): It can reflect the difference between the two source images and the fused image. The smaller the OCE is, the better fusion result that is obtained.
